1) All source code files are standard c++ files. Any c++ compiler will work

2) If the inpGen code is not being used, the text file must be in a specific format:
        The first line must contain four space separated integers N, K, C, BT
        N is the number of rows/columns in the square matrix, K is the number of threads, C is the number of logical cores available and BT is the 
        number of bound threads.
        The next N lines must contain the 2d matrix, with N space separated integers on each line

3) On execution, each code file will print a 2d matrix(A^2) along with the time taken to execute in its respective output file.

4) Two reports are attached, one of the being assignment 1's report which contains two of the required graphs for the report. The specific position to navigate
   to in the assignment 1 report is mentioned in the report for this assignment.
